    <h2>Some of the ingredients that would work well in sofrito.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 bunch of fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is worth nothing that while these are fairly common ingredients that you can use to make sofrito, you can add or include whatever ingredients are calling you. Get creative with it!
    </p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Peel the onion and deseed bell pepper, then quarter them. Rise the cilantro and chop the bunch roughly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the onion, bell pepper, cilantro, and garlic to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until a smooth, thick puree forms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the sofrito in a recipe immediately, store in an air-tight container for up to a month in the fridge, or portion into ice cube trays and store in the freezer for up to 3 months.
