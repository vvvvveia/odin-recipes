# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website that I am making to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and Git. I am building this website as part of The Odin Project ([read more](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)). I will not be using CSS to make this project look pretty, I am more focused on the HTML end of things and building good Git commit habits.

Thank you and have a good day.
